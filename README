OVERVIEW
========

OFELIA Control Framework (OCF) is a set of software tools for testbed
management. It controls experimentation life-cycle; reservation,
instantiation, configuration, monitoring and uninistantiation.

Features:

Full software stack: frontend, clearinghouse and resources managers
(AMs) Support for mangement of Openflow, Virtual Machines (currently XEN)
and Emulab resources.
OCF is currently deployed in OFELIA FP7 project testbed, the European
Openflow testbed. The ideas behind its architecture are heavily influenced
by the experience of other testbed management tools and GENI architectural
concepts. Take a look at Overview section for more details.


==============
INSTALLING OCF
==============

1. Requirements
---------------

* One (or more) GNU/Linux Debian-based distros (see Note #1)
  * Developed and ensured to work under Debian 6.0 (Squeeze)
* One (or more) GNU/Linux Debian-based distros to be virtualized by XEN
(Virtualization Manager installations only)
* FlowVisor (Opt-in Manager installations only) (automatically installed) 
* The following packages:
  * Python 2.6
  * Django 1.2.3 (automatically installed)
  * MySQL server (automatically installed)

Note #1: the OCF upgrading system (OFVER) [http://code.google.com/p/ofver/] 
supports Debian-based distros only. For other distros you shall install 
the components manually.


2. Installing
-------------

2.1 Clone the OCF repository under folder /opt:

    git clone https://github.com/fp7-ofelia/ocf.git /opt/ofelia

    Alternatively you can download the tarball and uncompress it there

2.2 For Expedient, Opt-in, VT manager: choose the components to install 
    as a root user. This will implicitly trigger OFVER:

    cd /opt/ofelia/deploy
    python install.py

    The following actions will take place: 
    * Install dependencies
    * Build Certificates (see Note #2)
    * Configure Apache
    * Set file permissions
    * Modify the localsettings.py or mySettings.py depending on the 
      component being installed
    * Populate database
    * When installation starts, ofver will ask if it is an OFELIA
      project installation or not. Select No (N) for non OFELIA testbeds.

    Note #2: When installing the component, you will need to create the
    certificates for the Certification Authority (CA) first and for the
    component later. Do not use the same Common Name (CN) for both of them,
    and make sure that the CN you use in the component later certificate
    (you can use an IP) is the same you then set in the SITE_DOMAIN field
    in the localsettings.py file.

2.3 For OXAD (XEN agent for virtualization purposes):

    Create the directory and clone the repository:
    
    mkdir -p /opt/ofelia/oxa
    git clone https://github.com/fp7-ofelia/ocf.git /opt/ofelia/oxa/repository

    The tree should look like:
    
    marc@foix:/opt/ofelia/oxa$ tree . -L 1
     '-- repository

    Trigger OFVER install by performing the following as a root user (see Note #3):

    cd /opt/ofelia/oxa/repository/vt_manager/src/python/agent/tools
    ./ofver install

    Note #3: When installation starts, ofver will ask if it is an OFELIA project 
    installation or not, and accordingly ofver will download the VMs templates 
    from the proper storage.


3. Upgrading
------------

3.1 For Expedient, Opt-in, VT manager: choose the components to install as a 
    root user. This will implicitly trigger OFVER:

    cd /opt/ofelia/deploy
    python upgrade.py

3.2 For OXAD (XEN agent for virtualization purposes):

    cd /opt/ofelia/oxa/repository/vt_manager/src/python/agent/tools
    ./ofver upgrade


4. Additional notes
-------------------

Please have a look to Manuals [https://github.com/fp7-ofelia/ocf/wiki/Manuals]
for further component configuration.

You can use -f force flag on OFVER to force installation/upgrade. Take a look
at ./ofver -h for more details.
