[T] VTA : Javascript bug regarding the addition of interfaces in the VT_AM (it deletes values in the form). Suggestion: first add all the interfaces needed, then put the values.
[T] EXP : Reboot machine is NOT working; this is due to an obscure bug in the libvirt library (we might have to use stop and then start method of libvirt, as sometimes reboot method in libvirt silently fails).
[T] EXP : Sometimes appears a NONE before Mgmt IP in the Resource visualization panel in Expedient. IP is correct though.
[-] EXP : New information in visualization panel for the Openflow resources.
[-] EXP/VTA : AJAX recovery of the VM status in both resource vis. panel in Expedient and VT_AM.

v0.1Alpha
--------------------------------------------------
Released: 15/03/2011

Change log:

[*] EXP : Customized version of Expedient; Apparence, simplification of the AMs selection on projects and slices (now is not necessary), plugin for Virtualization Aggregate Manager
[*] OPT : Customized version of Optin Manager: only look&feel
[*] EXP : Customized version of Expedient; Several things of apparence (look&feel, controls, visualization of topology...), simplification of the AMs selection on projects and slices (now is not necessary), plugin for Virtualization Aggregate Manager
[*] OPT : Customized version of Optin Manager: only look&feel
[*] VTA/AGN : XEN virtualization management (plugin + AM + agent)
Known BUGS and improvements:
[T] EXP : In the slice and project pages, Aggregate Managers box has to be deleted (since all the slices and projects use all AMs). In the slice a (unique) button must be put to specify Openflow controller instead of current approach
[T] VTA : Look and feel of both VT_AM and plugin needs to be improved.
[T] VTA : VT plugin fails to retrieve the status of the AM itself (it always OK status). while this is not corrected, the way to make sure Expedient is properly connected to the Virtualization AM, is to define a server in the AM (doesn't matter for the moment is not there ) try to allocate resource, and see that this servers is listed --> will be corrected soon.
[T] VTA : still doesn't correctly manage situations were connectivity problems appear between AM and Agent in the XEN server (not yet implemented) --> will be corrected soon.
[T] VTA : VT plugin still does not show servers on the topology (on process).
[T] VTA : VT_plugin does not refresh status of the VM that have pending actions in process (will be corrected via AJAX).
[T] EXP : Expedient DOES NOT use LDAP yet (LDAP code has not been merged to expedient in ofelia.development, since no LDAP server reachable for everyone is yet deployed)
[T] EXP : Expedient does not populate slice info to LDAP, and Agent still does not configure VMs to restrict login to them based on LDAP slice groups (not yet implemented).
[T] EXP : Expedient does not show in the topology the switch and host icons instead of boxes (this is indeed a bug from Stanford code that we will try to sort out).
